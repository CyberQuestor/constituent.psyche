## Psyche constituent

### Version
This pipeline is now **0.0.1**

_Target API version: **1.1.3.9**_

### Deployment
This section provides you details on how to provision HMLP on to HOLU. Refer to individual constituents git page for proposed port mappings and access keys. Do not forget to add access to event server as;

- Edit `/etc/default/haystack` and add base paths for event server at both announcer and consumer nodes.
    - `holu.base=http://192.168.136.90:7070`

#### Setup event pipeline
The first element is to generate access tokens denoted as prediction pipeline units.

- Execute the following to generate skeleton unit
    - `pio app new constituent.psyche`
    - Add `--access-key` parameter if you want to control key generated
        - It should be a 64-char string of the form `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ12`
- Record unit ID and access key. You will need this later.

#### Prepare constituent
It is time to prepare constituent unit files that eventually manifests as a HML pipeline.

- Retrieve engine files by cloning relevant git repository
    - Setup the folder as `mkdir -p /var/lib/haystack/pio/constituents/constituent.psyche`
    - Go to folder as `cd /var/lib/haystack/pio/constituents/constituent.psyche`
    - Generate structure folders as; `mkdir bin conf pipeline`
    - Go to pipeline folder and get all files as
        - Either clone to pipeline as, `git clone git@repo.haystack.one:server.tachyon/constituent.psyche.git pipeline`
        - Or if it is zipped, `unzip constituent.psyche.zip -d pipeline`
        - Make sure that the application name is set right at; `pipeline/engine.json`. Change `appName` to `constituent.psyche`.
    - Copy all scripts to bin as; `cp pipeline/src/main/resources/scripts/* bin/`
    - Copy configuration to conf as; `cp pipeline/src/main/resources/configuration/* conf/`
    - Ensure that all scripts have execute permission as; `chmod +x bin/*`
    - Get your configuration right as; `vi conf/pipeline.conf`
        - Pay attention to `HOSTNAME, HOST, ACCESS_KEY, TRAIN_MASTER, DEPLOY_MASTER, X_CORES and Y_MEMORY`
- Edit `/etc/default/haystack` and add access keys to denote addition of HMLP.
    - For **consumer** nodes;
        - `haystack.tachyon.events.dispatch.skeleton=<accesskey>`
- Complete events import through migration and turning on concomitant consumer

#### Initiate first time training and deploy
It is important to complete at least one iteration of build, train and deploy cycle prior to consumption.

- Go to folder as `cd /var/lib/haystack/pio/constituents/constituent.psyche/bin`
- Build the prediction unit as,
    - `./build`
- Train the predictive model as (ensure events migration is complete),
    - `./train`
- Deploy the prediction unit as,
    - `./deploy`
    - Do not kill the deployed process. Subsequent train and deploy would take care of provisioning it again.
    - You can verify deployed HMLP by visiting `http://192.168.136.90:17071/` and querying at `http://192.168.136.90:17071/queries.json `
- Edit `/etc/default/haystack` and add url keys to denote addition of HMLP.
- For **announcer** nodes;
    - `haystack.tachyon.pipeline.access.skeleton=http://192.168.136.90:17071`

#### Setup consecutive training and deploy
Now that we have successfully provisioned this HMLP; let us set it up for a periodic train-deploy cycle. Note that events are always consumed at real-time but are not accounted for until the next train cycle builds the model.

- Find the accompanying shell scripts of constituent and modify for consumption.
    - Go to constituent directory at;
        - `cd /var/lib/haystack/pio/constituents/constituent.psyche/`
    - Verify configuration is right as; `vi conf/pipeline.conf`
        - Adjust spark driver and executor settings as required
    - Do not forget to make scripts executable;
        - `chmod +x bin/*`
    - Ensure `pio build` is run at least once before enabling `cron` job.

Finally, setup crontab for executing these scripts. `mailutils` is used in this script. For Ubuntu, you can do `sudo update-alternatives --config mailx` and see if `/usr/bin/mail.mailutils` is selected.

- Edit crontab file as;
    - `crontab -e` for user level
    - Add the entry as;
        - `0 0,6,12,18 * * * /var/lib/haystack/pio/constituents/constituent.psyche/bin/redeploy >/dev/null 2>/dev/null`
        - Use `man cron` to check usage
        - Manage schedules in conjunction with all other HMLPs and ensure that trains do not overlap
    - Reload to take effect (optional)
        - `sudo service cron reload`
        - Restart if needed; `sudo systemctl restart cron`

You are all set!
